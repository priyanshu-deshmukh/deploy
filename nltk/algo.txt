INPUT: Raw text document

Step 1: Tokenize the text into words
    tokens = split text into individual words

Step 2: Load a list of stopwords
    stopwords = common words like "is", "the", etc.

Step 3: Filter out stopwords
    filtered_tokens = tokens excluding stopwords

Step 4: Apply stemming
    for each word in filtered_tokens:
        stemmed_word = get root form of word
        add to final list

OUTPUT: List of stemmed words after preprocessing
