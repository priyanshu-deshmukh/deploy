INPUT: List of documents

Step 1: Preprocess each document (tokenize, remove stopwords, etc.)

Step 2: For each document:
    For each word in document:
        Count frequency of word â†’ Term Frequency (TF)

Step 3: For each word in the whole corpus:
    Count how many documents contain the word
    Compute IDF = log(total_documents / documents_with_word)

Step 4: Multiply TF and IDF for each word in each document

OUTPUT: Matrix of TF-IDF values (word importance per document)
