Step 1: Initialize a 3x3 game board with empty values (spaces)

Step 2: Define a function to print the current board:
    Print each row with separators (|) and lines (---) between rows

Step 3: Define a function to check for a winning condition:
    Define all winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals)
    For each winning combination:
        If all three positions have the same player's mark:
            Return True (player wins)
    Return False (no win found)

Step 4: Define the main game loop:
    Set current_player to "X"
    Repeat for maximum of 9 turns:
        Print the board
        Ask player to choose a position (1-9)
        If chosen position is already filled:
            Show error and let them try again (continue loop)
        Place player's mark at chosen position
        If current_player has won:
            Print board and declare winner
            End game
        Switch current_player to the other player (X â†” O)

    After all moves:
        If no winner, declare a tie

Step 5: Start the game by calling the main game loop
