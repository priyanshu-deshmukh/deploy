INPUT: Labeled dataset of text reviews (texts + sentiment labels)

Step 1: Define the dataset
    - Create a list of text reviews
    - Assign each review a label ('pos' or 'neg')

Step 2: Create a machine learning pipeline
    - Use a TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert text to numeric features
    - Use a Logistic Regression model for classification

Step 3: Train the pipeline
    - Fit the model on the training data (texts and their labels)

Step 4: Make predictions
    - Take a new test sentence
    - Use the trained model to predict its sentiment

OUTPUT: Predicted sentiment label for the test input
