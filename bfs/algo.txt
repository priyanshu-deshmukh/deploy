BFS(Graph, start_node):
    create a queue Q
    mark start_node as visited and enqueue it into Q

    while Q is not empty:
        current_node = Q.dequeue()
        print(current_node)

        for each neighbor of current_node:
            if neighbor is not visited:
                mark neighbor as visited
                enqueue neighbor into Q
