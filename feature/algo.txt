6. Feature Extraction & Analysis on Processed Text
üîç Quick Info:
Feature Extraction: Converting raw text into a structured format that machine learning models can understand.

Common Techniques:

Bag of Words (BoW)

TF-IDF

Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)

Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging

Analysis: Checking distributions, correlations, and feature importance.

INPUT: Collection of text documents

Step 1: Preprocess the text
    - Tokenize
    - Remove stopwords
    - Apply stemming or lemmatization

Step 2: Convert text into numerical features
    - Choose feature extraction method (e.g., BoW or TF-IDF)
    - Apply method to the entire corpus to create feature vectors

Step 3: Analyze the extracted features
    - Check frequency of most common words
    - Use visualizations (e.g., word clouds, bar plots)
    - Examine vector shape, sparsity, etc.

OUTPUT: Structured feature matrix usable for ML models
